# Icons

Hover over an icon to display its name or click it to see its name logged to the
console.

**IMPORTANT: Importing icons directly for use is deprecated.**

Instead, to add and use a new icon, do the following:

1. Add the icon as a component in `src/icons/base`
2. Add the icon to both the `IconVariants` and `VariantIcons` reference objects in `src/icons/Icon/constants.ts`
3. Add a story for the icon to `src/icons/Icon/Icon.stories.tsx`
4. Use the icon by importing the `Icon` component with the applicable variant prop.

This may seem like more work, but it actually allows us to get new icons in components like `Label` for free, without having to modify those components directly!
